<p>Process mining is an analytical discipline for discovering, monitoring, and improving processes as they actually are (not as you think they might be), by extracting knowledge from event logs readily available in today’s information systems.

Process mining offers objective, fact-based insights, derived from actual data, that help you audit, analyze, and improve your existing business processes by answering both compliance-related and performance-related questions.

The technology is an essential part of the Celonis Execution Management System, enabling users to measure their execution capacity by fully understanding how their processes run before taking automated action to remove any execution gaps.</p>
